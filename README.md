The purpose of this project was to practice and do a small review of my JavaScript learning.

The main idea was to create a mobile app for street artists and customers where they could meet each other. An artist can put their art up for auction. The customer can bid in the auction.

An API has been added for simulation where it simulates another guest placing bids on an auction

This project is built in vanilla JavaScript. SASS was used for the styling system.
